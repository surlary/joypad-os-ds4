---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Xbox 360 console authentication (XSM3)** — adapters now authenticate with Xbox 360 consoles via XInput mode
- **PC Engine Mini USB output mode** — emulates HORI PCEngine PAD (VID 0x0F0D / PID 0x0138) for PC Engine Mini / TG-16 Mini consoles, with turbo fire support (10/15/20 Hz)
- **SInput USB host driver** — full-fidelity controller passthrough for SInput-compatible devices
- **SInput composite USB device** — gamepad, keyboard, and mouse interfaces in a single device
- **SNES rumble support** via LRG protocol
- **SNES d-pad mode toggle** and Home button combo in SNES host driver
- **Debug log streaming** over data CDC instead of separate debug port

- USB output interface documentation with web config and Xbox 360 details
- Neo Geo added to README with links to USB output docs and web config

### Fixed
- **TRIGGER_LIGHT_PRESS** now caps analog proportionally at all trigger values — fixes SSBM light shield being all-or-nothing (PR #68)

- **XSM3 auth routing** so Xbox 360 console authentication actually works end-to-end
- **DS5 USB lightbar** RGB not reflecting feedback system colors
- **DS4 lightbar** feedback — set default player LED colors on assignment
- **DS3 gyro/accel** normalized to SInput convention for consistent IMU output
- **3DO profile switching** combo detection
- SSBM profile: L2 digital threshold set to 0 so light shield never produces a digital press
- Skip log ring buffer writes when debug streaming is off (performance)

### Changed
- XInput product string changed to "Xbox 360 Controller" for better host compatibility

### Docs
- Neo Geo: latency test results and diagram (PR #67, community contribution by @herzmx)
- PC Engine: clarified pinout naming (CLR vs OE) and code variable mapping
